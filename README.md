Description

The neonutilities Python package provides utilities for discovering, downloading, and working with NEON data files. NEON data files can be downloaded from the NEON Data Portal (http://data.neonscience.org) or API (http://data.neonscience.org/data-api). NEON data files from instrumented and observation systems are delivered by NEON in tabular files organized by site and year-month. NEON data files from the airborne observation platform (AOP) are organized by site and year.

neonutilities is available on PyPi and most users will want to install it from there. If you want to use the current development version, you can install from GitHub, but be warned that the version here may not be stable.

See [NEON Data Tutorials](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials) for more information, particularly the [Download and Explore](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data) and [neonUtilities](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neondatastackr) tutorials.
